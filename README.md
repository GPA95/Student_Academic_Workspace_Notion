## 📦 Bonus Suggestion (Optional Advanced Setup)

If you're comfortable with Notion databases, you may want to build or wait for an upcoming version of the **Timetable as a dynamic database**.

A timetable database can allow custom views like:
 - **Board view grouped by Day** or Period
 - **Filtered timetable by Subject or Group**
 - Easy toggling of week/day schedules

 _I couldn't build this fully just yet — but I may update this repo if and when I successfully create it._  
 _Alternatively, feel free to experiment and extend the system!_
